# Peer Review with GitHub

In this group, you are going to use GitHub to provide peer review and editing for an article manuscript. The article manuscript is currently in the review phase for publication in [*Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments*](https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/). This project describes itself as:
>a curated collection of reusable and remixable pedagogical artifacts for humanities scholars in development by the Modern Language Association. 

Kim Middelton's article "Remix" is an apt choice for this demonstration, both in terms of its content and its current phase of production. Still in draft form, Kim's article is awaiting peer review. We will put the article into peer review and provide line-by-line feedback. Feel free to provide commentary, substantive suggestions for the text, or copy-editing notes. The point of the demonstration is to write a few lines in markdown and submit your commentary through GitHub. 

As you are working through this demonstration, please keep the instructions open in either a second window or next to you as a printout.

Because you don't have administrative privileges for this file, when you clicked on the edit button, GitHub created a new "forked" copy of the repository in your account's repositories. When you get done with your edits, you will save your copy of the repository and suggest that we adopt those changes through a "pull-request."  
5. In the section entitled Publication Status, change the publication status to undergoing review by changing which option is **bold**. To bold something you use <code>**two astericks**</code> before and after the word. For a full cheat sheet of markdown coding, please follow this link [**Markdown Cheat Sheet**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
